</p>


"WireColor Pro" (ex "ProColor") is a powerful script designed for Autodesk 3ds Max that enhances the workflow of 3D designers and artists by providing advanced tools for manipulating object colors, materials, and instances within a scene. This versatile script offers a range of features aimed at streamlining the colorization and materialization process for objects, groups, and instances.

## Features

1. **Random Colorization:** WireColor Pro enables users to effortlessly randomize the colors of 3D objects within their scenes. This feature is particularly useful for adding variety and visual interest to scenes.

2. **Color Palettes:** The script offers a selection of predefined color palettes, including options like pastel colors and black-and-white, allowing designers to maintain a consistent and harmonious color scheme.

3. **Group Colorization:** Beyond individual objects, designers can apply random colors to entire object groups, enhancing the ability to create organized and visually appealing scenes.

4. **Instance Color Sync:** Designers can opt to synchronize colors across instances, ensuring consistency and uniformity in scenes that utilize object duplication.

5. **Gradient Colorization:** The script introduces the ability to set gradient colors between selected objects. This allows for smooth transitions between colors, enhancing the visual flow of scenes.

6. **Material Conversion:** WireColor Pro provides the capability to convert object colors into material colors. Users can choose between physical and standard materials, enabling them to seamlessly integrate color and material attributes.

7. **Batch Material Removal:** The script streamlines the process of removing materials from multiple objects at once. This feature simplifies the cleanup of scenes and facilitates experimentation with different material options.

"WireColor Pro" revolutionizes the way 3D designers work with object colors and materials in Autodesk 3ds Max. By providing a comprehensive suite of tools for randomization, palette-based colorization, material conversion, batch material management, and instance color synchronization, this script empowers designers to achieve stunning visual results with greater efficiency and creative freedom. Whether working on architectural visualizations, product renderings, or animation projects, "WireColor Pro" is an indispensable asset that simplifies the process of color and material manipulation while enhancing the quality of the final output.
